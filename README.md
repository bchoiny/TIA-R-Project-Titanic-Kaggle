# TIA-R-Project-Titanic-Kaggle

This is my capstone project for The Infinite Actuary R course. I had some R experience from my work, but did not
have chance to use machine learning libraries. The course exposed me to common data cleaning techniques, visualizations, and couple of basic ML libraries which I will be utilizing below. Since I decided to focus on Python over R, I will be revisiting this competition with Python and do more in-depth analysis in the coming weeks!

Please check out my LinkedIn article on the road map for learning DS with Python as an actuary (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-data-science-actuary-resources-reviews-my-brian), especially if you are also working in actuarial field/insurance industry!

Here is output and kernel of the Rmarkdown: https://www.kaggle.com/bchoiny/titanic-rf-model-with-basic-feature-engineering
